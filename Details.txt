The Project consist of two things mainly i.e the src folder which consist of all the
source files and the Sample Inputs folder which consist the input as list that are fed
to the Program to compute the shortest path

Content Description:
	1. src 
		I. path_Finder
			a. BFS.java --> implements the Breadth First Search
			b. Djikstra.java --> implements the Djikstra's Algorithm

		II. structute : has the components required for the purpose
			a. Edge.java --> Structure for an edge of the graph
			b. Vertex.java --> Structure for a vertex of the graph
			c. Graph.java --> Uses the Vertex.java and Edge.java
					  to create a graph and implement several 
					  functions required for our purpose.
			d. LinkedList.java --> Contains the structure that helps us
						to connect the vertices using edges.
